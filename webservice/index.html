	    <b>FanFicFare Calibre Plugin</b>
	    <br /><br />
	    
	    There's also a version of this downloader that runs inside
	    the popular <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>
	    ebook management package as a plugin.
	    
	    <br /><br />
	    
	    Once you have Calibre installed and running, inside
	    Calibre, you can go to 'Get plugins to enhance calibre' or
	    'Get new plugins' and
	    install <a href="http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=259221">FanFicFare</a>.

	  A few additional things to know, which will make your life substantially easier:
	</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    First thing to know: We do not use your Google login and password. In fact, all we know about it is your ID &ndash; password
	    is being verified by Google and is absolutely, totally unknown to anyone but you.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    You can download fanfiction directly from your iPhone, Kindle or (possibly) other ebook reader.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Downloaded stories are deleted after some time (which should give you enough of time to download it and will keep
	    Google happy about the app not going over the storage limit).
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    If you see some funny characters in downloaded Plain Text file, make sure you choose text file encoding UTF-8 and
	    not something else.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    If you think that something that should work in fact doesn't, post a message to
	    our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/fanfic-downloader">Google Group</a>. we also encourage you to join it so
	    you will find out about latest updates and fixes as soon as possible
	  </li>
	</ol>
	Otherwise, just have fun, and if you want to say thank you &mdash; use the contacts above.
