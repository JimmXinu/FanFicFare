## [defaults] section applies to all formats and sites but may be
## overridden at several levels.  Example:

## [defaults]
## titlepage_entries: category,genre, status
## [www.whofic.com]
## # overrides defaults.
## titlepage_entries: category,genre, status,dateUpdated,rating
## [epub]

## # overrides defaults, site section & format section
## titlepage_entries: category,genre, status,datePublished
## [overrides]
## # overrides all other sections
## titlepage_entries: category

## Some sites also require the user to confirm they are adult for
## adult content.  Defaults to false.

## Try to collect series name and number of this story in series.
## Some sites (ab)use 'series' for reading lists and personal
## collections.  This lets us turn it on and off by site without
## keeping a lengthy titlepage_entries per site and prevents it
## updating in the plugin.
collect_series: true

## include title page as first page.
include_titlepage: true

## include a TOC page before the story text
include_tocpage: true

## website encoding(s) In theory, each website reports the character
## encoding they use for each page.  In practice, some sites report it
## incorrectly.  Each adapter has a default list, usually "utf8,
## Windows-1252" or "Windows-1252, utf8", but this will let you
## explicitly set the encoding and order if you need to.  The special
## value 'auto' will call chardet and use the encoding it reports if
## it has +90% confidence.  'auto' is not reliable.
#website_encodings: utf8, Windows-1252, iso-8859-1
## For sites (or individual stories) with problematic characters you
## can include ':ignore' after the encoding.  This will discard
## unrecognized characters, but likely also prevent the rest of the
## encoding list from ever being used.
#website_encodings: utf8:ignore, Windows-1252, iso-8859-1

## When using 'auto' in website_encodings, you can tweak the
## confidence required to use the chardet detected.
#chardet_confidence_limit:0.9

## entries to make epub subjects and calibre tags
## lastupdate creates two tags: "Last Update Year/Month: %Y/%m" and "Last Update: %Y/%m/%d"
include_subject_tags: extratags, genre, category, characters, ships, status

## extra tags (comma separated) to include, primarily for epub.
extratags: FanFiction

## extra categories, genres, characters, ships and warnings can be
## configured.  Used primarily for sites that are dedicated to a genre
## or 'ship and so don't included it for every story.
#extracategories:
#extragenres:
#extracharacters:
#extraships:
#extrawarnings:

## Add this to genre if there's more than one category.
#add_genre_when_multi_category: Crossover

## default_value_(entry) can be used to set the value for a metadata
## entry when no value has been found on the site.  For example, some
## sites doesn't have a status metadatum.  If uncommented, this will
## use 'Unknown' for status when no status is found.
#default_value_status:Unknown
## Can also be used for other metadata values
#default_value_category:FanFiction

## number of seconds to sleep between calls to the story site.  May be
## useful if pulling large numbers of stories or if the site is slow.
#slow_down_sleep_time:0.5

## How long to wait for each HTTP connection to finish.  Longer times
## are better for sites that are slow to respond.  Shorter times
## prevent excessive wait when your network or the site is down.
connect_timeout:60.0

## Use regular expressions to find and replace (or remove) metadata.
## For example, you could change Sci-Fi=>SF, remove *-Centered tags,
## etc.  See http://docs.python.org/library/re.html (look for re.sub)
## for regexp details.
##
## Make sure to keep at least one space at the start of each line and
## to escape % to %%, if used.
##
## Two, three or five part lines.  Two part effect everything.
## Three part effect only those key(s) lists.
## *Five* part lines.  Effect only when trailing conditional key=>regexp matches
## metakey[,metakey]=>pattern=>replacement[&&conditionalkey=>regexp]
##
## Note that if metakey == conditionalkey the conditional is ignored.
## You can use \s in the replacement to add explicit spaces.  (The config parser
## tends to discard trailing spaces.)
##
## replace_metadata <entry>_LIST options: FanFicFare replace_metadata lines
## operate on individual list items for list entries. But if you
## want to do a replacement on the joined string for the whole list,
## you can by using <entry>_LIST. Example, if you added
## calibre_author: calibre_author_LIST=>^(.{,100}).*$=>\1
##
## You can 'split' one list item into multiple list entries by using
## \, in the replacement string.
##
## Examples:
#replace_metadata:
# genre,category=>Sci-Fi=>SF
# Puella Magi Madoka Magica.* => Madoka
# Comedy=>Humor
# Crossover: (.*)=>\1
# title=>(.*)Great(.*)=>\1Moderate\2
# .*-Centered=>
# characters=>Sam W\.=>Sam Witwicky&&category=>Transformers
# characters=>Sam W\.=>Sam Winchester&&category=>Supernatural
# category=>Bitextual=>M/M\,F/M


## Include/Exclude metadata
##
## You can use the include/exclude metadata features to either limit
## the values of particular metadata lists to specific values or to
## exclude specific values.  Further, you can conditionally apply each
## line depending on other metadata, use exact strings or regular
## expressions(regex) to match values, and negate matches.
##
## The settings are:
## include_metadata_pre
## exclude_metadata_pre
## include_metadata_post
## exclude_metadata_post
##
## The form of each line is:
## metakey[,metakey]==exactvalue
## metakey[,metakey]=~regex
## metakey[,metakey]==exactvalue&&conditionalkey==exactcondvalue
## metakey[,metakey]=~regex&&conditionalkey==exactcondvalue
## metakey[,metakey]==exactvalue&&conditionalkey=~condregex
##
## This is fairly complicated, so it's documented on its own wiki
## page:
## https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare/wiki/InExcludeMetadataFeature

## When set true, conditionals for both replace_metadata and
## Include/Exclude metadata will check against each list value rather
## than the entire list as a string which was the case prior to this
## change (~Dec 2018).  replace_metadata conditionals (after &&) can
## also now use ==, !=, =~ and !~.  => is the same as =~ .)
## Set false to get the old behavior.  You can also compare the list
## as string by using <entry>_LIST, such as category_LIST
conditionals_use_lists:true

## You can exclude chapters from a story by listing their chapter URLs
## in ignore_chapter_url_list.  Chapter URLs will be normalized before
## being used, so you can use either longer or normalized chapter
## URLs.
## NOTE: This will cause numWords(word count) to be off for most sites.
## This setting should be used in a specific story's section.
## Example:
#[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/lengthy-thread-name.100849/]
#ignore_chapter_url_list:
# https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/10157294/

## Some readers don't show horizontal rule (<hr />) tags correctly.
## This replaces them all with a centered '* * *'.  (Note centering
## doesn't work on some devices either.)
#replace_hr: false

## Some sites/authors/stories use br tags instead of p tags for
## paragraphs.  This feature uses some heuristics to find and replace
## br paragraphs with p tags while preserving scene breaks.
#replace_br_with_p: false

## If you have the Generate Cover plugin installed, you can use the
## generate_cover_settings parameter to intelligently decide which GC
## setting to run.  There are three parts 1) a template of which
## metadata part(s) to look at, 2) a regular expression to match the
## template, and 3) the name of the GC setting to use, which must
## match exactly.  Use this parameter in [defaults], or by site eg,
## [ficwad.com]
## Make sure to keep at least one space at the start of each line and
## to escape % to %%, if used.
## template => regexp to match => GC Setting to use.
## To use this, make sure you go to the Generate Cover tab in FanFicFare
## config and check 'Allow generate_cover_settings from personal.ini
## to override'
## You can check for an existing cover image in the metadata
## cover_image.  cover_image can be:
## specific -- The site has an image that is specifically this story's cover
## first -- The first image in the story or story desc is used as cover
## default -- A default_cover_image was used
## old -- There was already a cover image in the epub.
## This is useful because GC plugin can use the existing image.
#generate_cover_settings:
# ${category} => Buffy:? [tT]he Vampire Slayer => BuffyCover
# ${category} => Star Trek => StarTrekCover
# ${cover_image} => => CompleteCover
# ${cover_image} => (specific|first|default) => CoverWithOrigImage

## (Plugin Only) - You can also populate calibre custom columns with
## the site specific metadata using custom_columns_settings (but only
## if 'Allow custom_columns_settings from personal.ini' is checked in
## the plugin GUI config.)  There are three parts, the entry name,
## then the label of the calibre custom column, then (optionally) a
## 'mode'.  'r' to Replace any existing values, 'a' to Add to existing
## value (use with tag-like columns), and 'n' for setting on New books
## only.  (Default is 'r'.)

## Literal strings can be set into custom columns using double quotes.
## Each metadata=>column mapping must be on a separate line and each
## needs to have one space at the start of each line.

## 'r_anthaver' and 'n_anthaver' can be used to indicate the same as
## 'r' and 'n' for normal downloads, but to average the metadata for
## the differents story in an anthology before setting in integer and
## float type custom columns.  This can be useful for a averrating
## column, for example.  Default is to sum the values of all stories,
## and numChapters and numWords are always summed.

#custom_columns_settings:
# cliches=>#acolumn
# themes=>#bcolumn,a
# timeline=>#ccolumn,n
# "FanFiction"=>#collection
# averrating=>#averrating,r_anthaver

## If set false, the summary will have all html stripped.
## Both this and include_images must be true to get images in the
## summary.
keep_summary_html:true

## If set true, any style attributes on tags in the story HTML will be
## kept.  Useful for keeping extra colors & formatting from original.
## DEPRECATED - use keep_html_attrs (or add_to_keep_html_attrs) instead.
#keep_style_attr: false

## If set true, any title attributes on tags in the story HTML will be
## kept.  Some sites(AO3) use <a title="Translation">Foreign language</a>
## DEPRECATED - use keep_html_attrs (or add_to_keep_html_attrs) instead.
#keep_title_attr: false

## Some attributes cause problems for EBook readers.  By default,
## FanFicFare will remove all attributes except the ones specified
## from all tags.  (The only exception is that <img> tags will also
## keep src, alt and longdesc attributes.  data-orighref is used by
## internalize_text_links to preserve links when chapters are
## inserted.)
## Example: To add 'style', 'title' and 'align' to the list to keep,
## in your personal.ini [defaults] put:
## add_to_keep_html_attrs:,style,title,align
keep_html_attrs:href,name,class,id,colspan,rowspan,data-orighref

## Tags listed here will be replaced with <span class="tagname">.
## For example: <u>underlined text</u> becomes
## <span class="u">underlined text</span>
## Note that the output_css should contain the class .u, .big, etc for
## the spans to be useful.
## This feature is for replacing old tags deprecated/removed in newer
## HTML and EPUB standards.
replace_tags_with_spans:u,big,small

## By default, empty tags are removed as part of cleaning up the
## source HTML.  However, a few tags should be kept even if empty.
## (Whitespace only, including &nbsp; is considered empty.)  This
## setting can adjust which tags are kept.
keep_empty_tags:p,td,th

## If a chapter range was given, use this pattern for the book title.
## replace_metadata and include/exclude will be applied *after* this.
## Set to empty value to disable.
title_chapter_range_pattern:${title} (Ch ${first}-${last})

## Don't like the numbers at the start of chapter titles on some
## sites?  You can use strip_chapter_numbers to strip them off.  Just
## want to make them all look the same?  Strip them off, then add them
## back on with add_chapter_numbers:true.  Only want them added back
## on for Table of Contents(toc)? Use add_chapter_numbers:toconly.
## (toconly doesn't work on mobi output.)  Don't like the way it
## strips numbers or adds them back?  See chapter_title_strip_pattern
## and chapter_title_add_pattern.
strip_chapter_numbers:false

## add_chapter_numbers can be true, false or toconly
## (Note number is not added when there's only one chapter.)
add_chapter_numbers:false

## (Two versions of chapter_title_strip_pattern are shown below.  You
## should only have one uncommented.)
## This version will remove the leading number from:
## "1." => ""
## "1. The Beginning" => "The Beginning"
## "1: Start" => "Start"
## "2, Chapter the second" => "Chapter the second"
## etc
## Leaves unchanged "1.1" or "1"
## Note that your ToC entry(ies) may be empty if the
## chapter_title_strip_pattern removes everything and you don't have
## add_chapter_numbers:true.
chapter_title_strip_pattern:^[0-9]+[\.: -]+(?=[^0-9]|$)

## This version remove leading numbers and 'Chapter 1':
## "Chapter 1" => ""
## "1. Chapter 1" => ""
## "1. Chapter 1, Bob's First Clue" => "Bob's First Clue"
## "Chapter 2 - Pirates Place" => "Pirates Place"
## etc
## Note that your ToC entry(ies) may be empty if the
## chapter_title_strip_pattern removes everything and you don't have
## add_chapter_numbers:true.
#chapter_title_strip_pattern:^([0-9]+[\.: -]+)?(Chapter *[0-9]+[\.:, -]*)?

## If true, when updating an epub that already has old chapters, new
## chapters will be marked in the TOC and chapter header by using
## chapter_title_new_pattern and chapter_title_addnew_pattern to set
## the chapter title.
## If set to latestonly, only new chapters downloaded this time will
## be marked (new) and existing chapters will have any (new) marks
## removed.
## mark_new_chapters can be true, false or latestonly
mark_new_chapters:false

## chapter title patterns use python template substitution.  The
## ${number} is the 'chapter' number and ${title} is the chapter
## title, after applying chapter_title_strip_pattern.  ${index04} is
## chapter number padded with leading zeros (mostly for internal use)
## such as 0001.  ${index} == ${number} for backward compatibility.  A
## few site adapters add additional chapter metadata.

## The basic pattern used when not using add_chapter_numbers or
## mark_new_chapters
chapter_title_def_pattern:${title}

## Pattern used with add_chapter_numbers, but not mark_new_chapters
chapter_title_add_pattern:${number}. ${title}

## Pattern used with mark_new_chapters, but not add_chapter_numbers

## Pattern used with add_chapter_numbers and mark_new_chapters
## (new) is just text and can be changed.

## sort_ships_splits.
sort_ships:false

## Each line indicates first a regex that should be used to split each
## ships entry and then, after => the string to use to merge the parts
## back together.  \s == blank space.
## Each part will have replace_metadata with key ships_CHARS applied.
sort_ships_splits:
 [ ]*/[ ]*=>/
 [ ]*&amp;[ ]*=>\s&amp;\s

## join_string_<entry> options -- FanFicFare list entries are comma
## separated by default. You can use this to change that. For example,
## if you want authors separated with ' & ' instead, use
## join_string_calibre_author:\s&\s. (\s == space)
#join_string_author:,\s

## keep_in_order_<entry> options: FanFicFare sorts list entries by default
## (except for author/authorUrl/authorId). But if you want to use an
## extra entry derived from author, it ends up sorted. For example, if
## you added calibre_author: keep_in_order_calibre_author:true
#keep_in_order_author:true

## Because some adapters can pull chapter URLs from human posts, the

## Some authors use 'Zalgo' text--arbitrary and often excessive
## added/combined unicode markings--to indicate 'noise' of some kind.
## While a critical part of some languages, when over used it can also
## cause problems for some ebook readers, such as Kindle.
## https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6579844/how-does-zalgo-text-work
## This setting will reduce the number 'Zalgo' characters.  Set to 0

## applied to other sites.
always_reload_first_chapter:false

## In normal operation, forumtags will only be populated when
## threadmarks are used for chapters (see minimum_threadmarks above).
## When always_use_forumtags:true, always populate forumtags.
always_use_forumtags:false

## base_xenforoforum sites sometimes have 'spoiler' blocks in
## posts. When viewed in a browser, the block is hidden until a button
## is clicked.  eBook viewers can't handle that and the javascript is
## disabled.  The remove_spoilers option, if uncommented, will remove
## spoiler blocks entirely.
#remove_spoilers:true

## This option if uncommented, will put a box around the spoiler
## blocks with the original spoiler button text as a label using
## fieldset and legend HTML tags.  For a simple box, see the
## add_to_output_css example for [base_xenforoforum:epub] below.
#legend_spoilers:true

## True by built-in default, but only applied if using threadmarks for
## chapters and a 'reader' URL is found in the thread, 'reader mode'
## will reduce the number of pages fetched by roughly 10 to 1 for a
## full story download by using the threadmarks-only reader pages.
## Only SV had reader mode as of Nov 2016.
#use_reader_mode:true

## In case the number of posts per reader page changes.  Built-in default is
## 10.
#reader_posts_per_page:10

## xenforoforum has categories of threadmarks.  This setting allows
## you to leave out categories you don't want.  Skipping categories
## will also speed downloads as categories other than 'Threadmarks'
## don't use Reader Mode.
## The last known list of categories is:
## Threadmarks,Sidestory,Apocrypha,Media,Informational,Staff Post
#skip_threadmarks_categories:Staff Post

## I'm not a fan of using the word 'Apocrypha' for the threadmark
## category when everybody usually calls them Omake.  Set true to
## change Apocrypha to Omake.  Applied *after*
## skip_threadmarks_categories.
#apocrypha_to_omake:false

## SV & SB (and possibly QQ and AH) like to use sprite smilies --
## smiley images that are all in one image file for performance and
## are shown by CSS background with offsets.  Epub viewers don't like
## that.
##
## The sprite smiley img tags generally do have alt attributes that get
## the point across: ":)" ":D" ":(" ":lol" etc.  And not all smilies
## on these sites use sprite images, so some can be used as is.
##
## When replace_failed_smilies_with_alt_text:true, any images that
## failed to download or are src=clear.png *and* have a class containing
## mceSmilie and an alt attribute will be replaced with:
## <span class="(classes)">(alt text)</span>
##
## The smiley classes are preserved in case the user wants to do
## something special with them.
#replace_failed_smilies_with_alt_text:false

## SB, SV & QQ (but not AH) provide word counts with threadmarks.  Set
## use_threadmark_wordcounts:true to sum and use them to fill
## numWords.  skip_threadmarks_categories and ignore_chapter_url_list
## are applied *before* summing.
## SB, SV & QQ base_xenforoforum sites using use_threadmark_wordcounts
## is one of the few cases where numWords is effected by
## ignore_chapter_url_list.
## Note: that if always_include_first_post is true, first post will not
## be included in the word count if not also threadmarked.
## Note 2: Word counts from the site exclude words inside Spoiler
## tags.
use_threadmark_wordcounts:true

## base_xenforoforum stories with threadmarks have a few additional
## pieces of metadata available that most adapters don't. 'date';
## 'words'--word count as number only: "12104"; and kwords--the
## threadmark human-readable string for word count with parens:
## "(12.1k)" These can be used with custom output (see
## https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare/wiki/CustomOutput ) or with
## chapter_title_*_pattern settings.
## Examples for html & epub:
#[html]
#tocpage_entry:
# <a href="#section${index04}">${chapter}</a> ${date} ${kwords}<br />
#[epub]
#tocpage_entry:
# <a href="file${index04}.xhtml">${chapter}</a> ${date} ${kwords}<br /><br />

## The 'date' value for chapters mentioned above can be formated with
## datethreadmark_format.  Otherwise it will default to
## dateCreated_format
#datethreadmark_format:%%Y-%%m-%%d %%H:%%M

## When set true, always_include_first_post_chapters will cause FFF to
## treat both threadmarks *and* first post links as chapter links.
#always_include_first_post_chapters:false

[base_xenforoforum:epub]

## See remove_spoilers above for more about 'spoilers'.  This example
## shows how to put a simple line around spoiler blocks.  Uncomment
## all three lines, keep the leading space before .bbCodeSpoilerContainer.
#add_to_keep_html_attrs:,style
#add_to_output_css:
# .bbCodeSpoilerContainer { border: 1px solid black; padding: 2px; }

[base_xenforo2forum]

## precedence.  SV is the only XF2 site as of Jul 2019.

# Just to remove '_'.
threadmarks_title_label:Threadmarks Title
threadmarks_description_label:Threadmarks Description
threadmarks_status_label:Threadmarks Status

## When use_threadmarks_description is set true,
## threadmarks_description will be used to fill in the standard
## description metadata entry.  Some stories have poor
## threadmarks_description, you can use this setting to avoid using
## it.
use_threadmarks_description:true
## Increasing description_limit from base_xenforoforum's default of
## 500 is also useful with use_threadmarks_description
description_limit:1000

## When use_threadmarks_status is set true, a normalized version of
## threadmarks_status will be used to fill in the standard status
## metadata entry. (In-Progress, Completed plus site statuses.)
use_threadmarks_status:true

## When use_threadmarks_cover is set true, the threadmarks image will
## be used to fill in the cover image.  Set true by default.
use_threadmarks_cover:true

[epub]

## Each output format has a section that overrides [defaults]

## epub carries the TOC in metadata.
## mobi generated from epub by calibre will have a TOC at the end.
include_tocpage: false

## include a Update Log page before the story text.  If 'true', the
## log will be updated each time the epub is and all the metadata
## fields that have changed since the last update (typically
## dateUpdated,numChapters,numWords at a minimum) will be shown.
## Great for tracking when chapters came out and when the description,
## etc changed.
include_logpage: false
## If set to 'smart', logpage will only be included if the story is
## status:In-Progress or already had a logpage.  That way you don't
## end up with Completed stories that have just one logpage entry.
#include_logpage: smart

## By default, logpage is placed before the story chapters.  This
## setting, if true, will place the logpage after the chapters
## instead.
logpage_at_end: false

## items to include in the log page Empty metadata entries, or those
## that haven't changed since the last update, will *not* appear, even
## if in the list.  You can include extra text or HTML that will be
## included as-is in each log entry. Eg: logpage_entries: ...,<br />,

#[html]

#[epub]
#tocpage_entry:
# <a href="file${index04}.xhtml">${chapter}</a> ${date} ${size}<br /><br />

## TtH uses 'category' Buffy-Centered, Xander-Centered, etc.  If
## centeredcat_to_characters:true, they will not be included in the

## the characters list.

## TtH uses 'category' Pairing: Dawn, Pairing: Willow, etc, but only
## if there's already been a -Centered category, like Xander-Centered.
## If pairingcat_to_characters_ships:true, Pairing: Whomever will not
## be included in the category list and Dawn, Willow, etc will instead
## be included in the characters list *and* an entry added to the
## ships list for Centered character / Pairing character.  IE,
## category: Xander-Centered, Pairing: Dawn becomes characters:
## Xander, Dawn and ships: Xander/Dawn.
pairingcat_to_characters_ships:true

## TtH uses 'category' Romance followed by a pairing 'category', such
## as Romance > Buffy/Spike.  If romancecat_to_characters_ships:true,
## Romance will still be added to category, but Buffy/Spike will
## instead be added to characters Buffy, Spike and ships Buffy/Spike
