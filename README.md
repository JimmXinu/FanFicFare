FanFicFare
==========

[This is the repository for the FanFicFare project.](https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare)

FanFicFare is the rename and move of the previous FanFictionDownLoader (AKA
FFDL, AKA fanficdownloader) project.

This program is available as a [calibre
plugin](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=3084025), a
[command-line interface](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/FanFicFare) (via
pip), and a [web service](http://fanficfare.appspot.com/).

The cli version can also be obtained on Arch Linux from the official repositories:

```
pacman -S fanficfare
```

or from git via the [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/fanficfare-git)
(which will also update the calibre plugin, if calibre is installed).

There's additional info in the project
[wiki](https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare/wiki) pages.

There's also a [FanFicFare
maillist](https://groups.google.com/group/fanfic-downloader) for
discussion and announcements.
