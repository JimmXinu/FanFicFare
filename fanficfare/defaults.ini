[defaults]

## [defaults] section applies to all formats and sites but may be
## overridden at several levels.  Example:

## [defaults]
## titlepage_entries: category,genre, status
## [www.whofic.com]
## # overrides defaults.
## titlepage_entries: category,genre, status,dateUpdated,rating
## [epub]
## # overrides defaults & site section
## titlepage_entries: category,genre,status,datePublished,dateUpdated,dateCreated
## [www.whofic.com:epub]
## # overrides defaults, site section & format section
## titlepage_entries: category,genre, status,datePublished
## [overrides]
## # overrides all other sections
## titlepage_entries: category

## Some sites also require the user to confirm they are adult for
## adult content.  Defaults to false.
is_adult:false

## All available titlepage_entries and the label used for them:
## <entryname>_label:<label>
## Labels may be customized.

## Category and Genre have overlap, depending on the site.
## Sometimes Harry Potter is a category and Fantasy a genre. (fanfiction.net)
## Sometimes Fantasy is category *and* a genre (fictionpress.com)
## Sometimes there are multiple categories and/or genres.

## The metadata entry 'site' predates Calibre integration, and was
## later labeled Publisher and used to fill Calibre's Publisher field.
## Because users keep expecting it to be 'publisher' instead,
## 'publisher' is now a copy of 'site' and the Calibre plugin now uses
## 'publisher' instead.  Default titlepage_entries are also changed.

## Items to include in the title page
## Empty metadata entries will *not* appear, unless .SHOW_EMPTY is
## appended.  Eg: titlepage_entries: ..., characters.SHOW_EMPTY,

## Relationships if there are any.  You can include extra text or HTML
## that will be included as-is in the title page. Eg:
## titlepage_entries: ...,<br />,summary,<br />,...
## All current formats already include title and author.

## Try to collect series name and number of this story in series.
## Some sites (ab)use 'series' for reading lists and personal

## include a TOC page before the story text
include_tocpage: true

## website encoding(s) In theory, each website reports the character
## encoding they use for each page.  In practice, some sites report it
## incorrectly.  Each adapter has a default list, usually "utf8,
## Windows-1252" or "Windows-1252, utf8", but this will let you
## explicitly set the encoding and order if you need to.  The special
## value 'auto' will call chardet and use the encoding it reports if
## it has +90% confidence.  'auto' is not reliable.
#website_encodings: utf8, Windows-1252, iso-8859-1
## For sites (or individual stories) with problematic characters you
## can include ':ignore' after the encoding.  This will discard
## unrecognized characters, but likely also prevent the rest of the
## encoding list from ever being used.
#website_encodings: utf8:ignore, Windows-1252, iso-8859-1

## When using 'auto' in website_encodings, you can tweak the
## confidence required to use the chardet detected.
#chardet_confidence_limit:0.9

## Make directories as needed.
make_directories: true

## Always overwrite output files.  Otherwise, the downloader checks
## the timestamp on the existing file and only overwrites if the story
## has been updated more recently.  Command line version only
#always_overwrite: true

## put output (with output_filename) in a zip file zip_filename.
zip_output: false

## Can include directories.
zip_filename: ${title}-${siteabbrev}_${storyId}${formatext}.zip

## Add this category if there's more than one category(before this is added).
## Applied *after* category replace_metadata/include/exclude_metadata
#add_category_when_multi_category: Crossover

## default_value_(entry) can be used to set the value for a metadata
## entry when no value has been found on the site.  For example, some
## sites doesn't have a status metadatum.  If uncommented, this will
## use 'Unknown' for status when no status is found.
#default_value_status:Unknown
## Can also be used for other metadata values
#default_value_category:FanFiction

## number of seconds to sleep between calls to the story site.  May be
## useful if pulling large numbers of stories or if the site is slow.
#slow_down_sleep_time:0.5

## How long to wait for each HTTP connection to finish.  Longer times
## are better for sites that are slow to respond.  Shorter times
## prevent excessive wait when your network or the site is down.

## For use only with CLI version--run a command on the generated file
## after it's produced.  All of the titlepage_entries values are
## available, plus output_filename.
#post_process_cmd: addbook -f "${output_filename}" -t "${title}"

## Some operating systems and command shells have problems with some
## characters.  When set, post_process_safepattern will be applied to
## each metadata item passed to post_process_cmd before it's called.
#post_process_safepattern:(^\.|/\.|[^a-zA-Z0-9_\. \[\]\(\)&'-]+)

## For use only with CLI version--run a command 3*before* the output
## file is written.  All of the titlepage_entries values are
## available, (but not output_filename).  Can be used to generate
## cover images that are then included in the output ebook using
## default_cover_image.
#pre_process_cmd:tenprintcover.py --author "${author}" --title "${title}" --cover cover.png

## Some operating systems and command shells have problems with some
## characters.  When set, pre_process_safepattern will be applied to
## each metadata item passed to pre_process_cmd before it's called.
#pre_process_safepattern:(^\.|/\.|[^a-zA-Z0-9_\. \[\]\(\)&'-]+)

## For use only with CLI version--display a simple progress bar while
## downloading--one dot(.) per network fetch.  Same as using --progressbar
#progressbar:false

## Use regular expressions to find and replace (or remove) metadata.
## For example, you could change Sci-Fi=>SF, remove *-Centered tags,
## etc.  See http://docs.python.org/library/re.html (look for re.sub)
## for regexp details.
##
## Make sure to keep at least one space at the start of each line and
## to escape % to %%, if used.
##
## Two, three or five part lines.  Two part effect everything.
## Three part effect only those key(s) lists.
## *Five* part lines.  Effect only when trailing conditional key=>regexp matches
## metakey[,metakey]=>pattern=>replacement[&&conditionalkey=>regexp]
##
## Note that if metakey == conditionalkey the conditional is ignored.
## You can use \s in the replacement to add explicit spaces.  (The config parser
## tends to discard trailing spaces.)
##
## replace_metadata <entry>_LIST options: FanFicFare replace_metadata lines
## operate on individual list items for list entries. But if you
## want to do a replacement on the joined string for the whole list,
## you can by using <entry>_LIST. Example, if you added
## calibre_author: calibre_author_LIST=>^(.{,100}).*$=>\1
##
## You can 'split' one list item into multiple list entries by using
## \, in the replacement string.
##
## Examples:
#replace_metadata:
# genre,category=>Sci-Fi=>SF
# Puella Magi Madoka Magica.*=>Madoka
# Comedy=>Humor
# Crossover: (.*)=>\1
# title=>(.*)Great(.*)=>\1Moderate\2
# .*-Centered=>
# characters=>Sam W\.=>Sam Witwicky&&category=>Transformers
# characters=>Sam W\.=>Sam Winchester&&category=>Supernatural
# category=>Bitextual=>M/M\,F/M


## Include/Exclude metadata
##
## You can use the include/exclude metadata features to either limit
## the values of particular metadata lists to specific values or to
## exclude specific values.  Further, you can conditionally apply each
## line depending on other metadata, use exact strings or regular
## expressions(regex) to match values, and negate matches.
##
## The settings are:
## include_metadata_pre
## exclude_metadata_pre
## include_metadata_post
## exclude_metadata_post
##
## The form of each line is:
## metakey[,metakey]==exactvalue
## metakey[,metakey]=~regex
## metakey[,metakey]==exactvalue&&conditionalkey==exactcondvalue
## metakey[,metakey]=~regex&&conditionalkey==exactcondvalue
## metakey[,metakey]==exactvalue&&conditionalkey=~condregex
##
## This is fairly complicated, so it's documented on its own wiki
## page:
## https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare/wiki/InExcludeMetadataFeature

## When set true, conditionals for both replace_metadata and
## Include/Exclude metadata will check against each list value rather
## than the entire list as a string which was the case prior to this
## change (~Dec 2018).  replace_metadata conditionals (after &&) can
## also now use ==, !=, =~ and !~.  => is the same as =~ .)
## Set false to get the old behavior.  You can also compare the list
## as string by using <entry>_LIST, such as category_LIST
conditionals_use_lists:true

## You can exclude chapters from a story by listing their chapter URLs
## in ignore_chapter_url_list.  Chapter URLs will be normalized before
## being used, so you can use either longer or normalized chapter
## URLs.
## NOTE: This will cause numWords(word count) to be off for most sites.
## This setting should be used in a specific story's section.
## Example:
#[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/lengthy-thread-name.100849/]
#ignore_chapter_url_list:
# https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/10157294/

# https://forums.spacebattles.com/posts/10157299/
# https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/lengthy-thread-name.100849/#post-10157400

## Rarely, some stories on some sites (observed on SpaceBattles) might
## have the same chapter URL listed more than once.  Set true for
## those stories.
#dedup_chapter_list:false

## Some sites/authors/stories use several br tags for scene/section
## breaks.  When set replace_xbr_with_hr:X will cause FFF to search
## for X or more consecutive br tags and replace them with br br hr br.
#replace_xbr_with_hr:3

## Some readers don't show horizontal rule (<hr />) tags correctly.
## This replaces them all with a centered '* * *'.  (Note centering
## doesn't work on some devices either.)
#replace_hr: false

## Some sites/authors/stories use br tags instead of p tags for
## paragraphs.  This feature uses some heuristics to find and replace
## br paragraphs with p tags while preserving scene breaks.
#replace_br_with_p: false

## If set false, the summary will have all html stripped.
## Both this and include_images must be true to get images in the
## summary.
keep_summary_html:true

## If set true, any style attributes on tags in the story HTML will be
## kept.  Useful for keeping extra colors & formatting from original.
## DEPRECATED - use keep_html_attrs (or add_to_keep_html_attrs) instead.
#keep_style_attr: false

## If set true, any title attributes on tags in the story HTML will be
## kept.  Some sites(AO3) use <a title="Translation">Foreign language</a>
## DEPRECATED - use keep_html_attrs (or add_to_keep_html_attrs) instead.
#keep_title_attr: false

## Some attributes cause problems for EBook readers.  By default,
## FanFicFare will remove all attributes except the ones specified
## from all tags.  (The only exception is that <img> tags will also
## keep src, alt and longdesc attributes.  data-orighref is used by
## internalize_text_links to preserve links when chapters are
## inserted.)
## Example: To add 'style', 'title' and 'align' to the list to keep,
## in your personal.ini [defaults] put:
## add_to_keep_html_attrs:,style,title,align
keep_html_attrs:href,name,class,id,colspan,rowspan,data-orighref

## Tags listed here will be replaced with <span class="tagname">.
## For example: <u>underlined text</u> becomes
## <span class="u">underlined text</span>
## Note that the output_css should contain the class .u, .big, etc for
## the spans to be useful.
## This feature is for replacing old tags deprecated/removed in newer
## HTML and EPUB standards.
replace_tags_with_spans:u,big,small

## By default, empty tags are removed as part of cleaning up the
## source HTML.  However, a few tags should be kept even if empty.
## (Whitespace only, including &nbsp; is considered empty.)  This
## setting can adjust which tags are kept.
keep_empty_tags:p,td,th

## If a chapter range was given, use this pattern for the book title.
## replace_metadata and include/exclude will be applied *after* this.
## Set to empty value to disable.

## Don't like the numbers at the start of chapter titles on some

## (toconly doesn't work on mobi output.)  Don't like the way it
## strips numbers or adds them back?  See chapter_title_strip_pattern
## and chapter_title_add_pattern.

## (Note number is not added when there's only one chapter.)

## (Two versions of chapter_title_strip_pattern are shown below.  You

## This version will remove the leading number from:
## "1." => ""
## "1. The Beginning" => "The Beginning"
## "1: Start" => "Start"
## "2, Chapter the second" => "Chapter the second"
## etc
## Leaves unchanged "1.1" or "1"
## Note that your ToC entry(ies) may be empty if the
## chapter_title_strip_pattern removes everything and you don't have
## add_chapter_numbers:true.
chapter_title_strip_pattern:^[0-9]+[\.: -]+(?=[^0-9]|$)

## "1. Chapter 1" => ""
## "1. Chapter 1, Bob's First Clue" => "Bob's First Clue"
## "Chapter 2 - Pirates Place" => "Pirates Place"

#chapter_title_strip_pattern:^([0-9]+[\.: -]+)?(Chapter *[0-9]+[\.:, -]*)?

## If true, when updating an epub that already has old chapters, new
## chapters will be marked in the TOC and chapter header by using
## chapter_title_new_pattern and chapter_title_addnew_pattern to set
## the chapter title.
## If set to latestonly, only new chapters downloaded this time will
## be marked (new) and existing chapters will have any (new) marks
## removed.
## mark_new_chapters can be true, false or latestonly
mark_new_chapters:false

## chapter title patterns use python template substitution.  The
## ${number} is the 'chapter' number and ${title} is the chapter
## title, after applying chapter_title_strip_pattern.  ${index04} is
## chapter number padded with leading zeros (mostly for internal use)
## such as 0001.  ${index} == ${number} for backward compatibility.  A
## few site adapters add additional chapter metadata.

## The basic pattern used when not using add_chapter_numbers or
## mark_new_chapters

## sort_ships_splits.
sort_ships:false

## Each line indicates first a regex that should be used to split each
## ships entry and then, after => the string to use to merge the parts
## back together.  \s == blank space.
## Each part will have replace_metadata with key ships_CHARS applied.
sort_ships_splits:

## join_string_<entry> options -- FanFicFare list entries are comma
## separated by default. You can use this to change that. For example,
## if you want authors separated with ' & ' instead, use
## join_string_calibre_author:\s&\s. (\s == space)
#join_string_author:,\s

## keep_in_order_<entry> options: FanFicFare sorts list entries by default
## (except for author/authorUrl/authorId). But if you want to use an
## extra entry derived from author, it ends up sorted. For example, if
## you added calibre_author: keep_in_order_calibre_author:true
#keep_in_order_author:true

## User-agent
user_agent:FFF/2.X

## Added for [base_xenforoforum], but can be used with other sites,
## too.  Limit the 'description' to the first X *characters*
## collected.  Character count includes HTML tags, so it can be
## non-intuitive.
#description_limit:1000

## Because some adapters can pull chapter URLs from human posts, the
## odds of errors in the chapter URLs can be higher for some
## sites/stories.  You can set continue_on_chapter_error:true to
## continue on after failing to download a chapter and instead record
## an error message in the ebook for that chapter.

## The FFF CLI can fetch story URLs from unread emails when configured
## to read from your IMAP mail server.  The example shows GMail, but
## other services that support IMAP can be used.  GMail requires you
## to turn on an option to enable IMAP access. Only the CLI uses these
## options--the Calibre Plugin stores these separately.
##
## It's safest if you create a separate email account that you use
## only for your story update notices.  FanFicFare cannot guarantee
## that malicious code cannot get your email password once you've
## saved it. Use this feature at your own risk.

## Mark mails with story URLs read:

## to download story URLs from email are used.
##
## If 'downloadonly', unread emails will be marked as read
## only when CLI --download-imap to download story URLs from email are

## base_xenforoforum reads Published and Updated datetimes from
## Threadmarks if used, or from the posted & updated times of the
## 'first' post if no threadmarks.
datePublished_format:%%Y-%%m-%%d %%H:%%M
dateUpdated_format:%%Y-%%m-%%d %%H:%%M

## Only take the first X characters of the 'first' post to use as
## the description.
description_limit:500

## When given a thread URL, use threadmarks as chapter links when
## there are at least this many threadmarks.  A number of older
## threads have a single threadmark to an 'index' post.  Set to 1 to
## use threadmarks whenever they exist.
minimum_threadmarks:2

## When 'first post' (or post URL) is being added as a chapter, give
## the chapter this title.
first_post_title:First Post

## In normal operation, if given a post URL or a thread URL with less
## than minimum_threadmarks, the given post or the first post of the
## thread will be included as the first chapter (with chapter title
## from first_post_title) unless that post is explicitly linked to in
## the collected chapter list.  First post is not included when using
## thread marks unless threadmarked.
##
## If always_include_first_post:true, then the given or first post
## will be included as above even if it is a link in the post or even
## if threadmarks are used.  Can result in a duplicated chapter.
always_include_first_post:false

## In normal operation, when updating an existing epub, old chapters
## will be reused as-is.  Normally, that works fine, but forum stories
## sometimes have an index post as the first 'chapter', and the
## version in the first chapter gets out of sync.
##
## If always_reload_first_chapter:true, then the first chapter will
## always be downloaded again (ie, reloaded).  It will NOT be maked
## '(new)' (see mark_new_chapters).  Because it is reloaded, manual
## edits made to the first chapter will be lost.
##
## While intended for base_xenforoforum sites, this setting can be
## applied to other sites.
always_reload_first_chapter:false

## In normal operation, forumtags will only be populated when
## threadmarks are used for chapters (see minimum_threadmarks above).
## When always_use_forumtags:true, always populate forumtags.
always_use_forumtags:false

## base_xenforoforum sites sometimes have 'spoiler' blocks in
## posts. When viewed in a browser, the block is hidden until a button
## is clicked.  eBook viewers can't handle that and the javascript is
## disabled.  The remove_spoilers option, if uncommented, will remove
## spoiler blocks entirely.
#remove_spoilers:true

## This option if uncommented, will put a box around the spoiler
## blocks with the original spoiler button text as a label using
## fieldset and legend HTML tags.  For a simple box, see the
## add_to_output_css example for [base_xenforoforum:epub] below.
#legend_spoilers:true

## True by built-in default, but only applied if using threadmarks for
## chapters and a 'reader' URL is found in the thread, 'reader mode'
## will reduce the number of pages fetched by roughly 10 to 1 for a
## full story download by using the threadmarks-only reader pages.
#use_reader_mode:true

## In case the number of posts per reader page changes.  Built-in default is
## 10.
#reader_posts_per_page:10

## xenforoforum has categories of threadmarks.  This setting allows
## you to leave out categories you don't want.  Skipping categories
## will also speed downloads as categories other than 'Threadmarks'
## don't use Reader Mode.
## The last known list of categories is:
## Threadmarks,Sidestory,Apocrypha,Media,Informational,Staff Post
#skip_threadmarks_categories:Staff Post

## I'm not a fan of using the word 'Apocrypha' for the threadmark
## category when everybody usually calls them Omake.  Set true to
## change Apocrypha to Omake.  Applied *after*
## skip_threadmarks_categories.
#apocrypha_to_omake:false

## If desired, you can change the order FFF places threadmark
## categories.  (This setting does not remove categories, you need to
## use skip_threadmarks_categories for that.)
#threadmark_category_order:Threadmarks,Sidestory,Apocrypha,Omake,Media,Informational,Staff Post

## By default, FFF orders threadmarks first by category, then in the
## order they appear as determined by the author.  When
## order_threadmarks_by_date:true, all included threadmarks
## (skip_threadmarks_categories still works) will instead be ordered
## by their initial post datetime.  Different threadmark categories
## will be mixed together, and I've seen at least one case of post
## order on the site disagreeing with post datetime.
#order_threadmarks_by_date:false

## SV & SB (and possibly QQ and AH) like to use sprite smilies --
## smiley images that are all in one image file for performance and
## are shown by CSS background with offsets.  Epub viewers don't like
## that.
##
## The sprite smiley img tags generally do have alt attributes that get
## the point across: ":)" ":D" ":(" ":lol" etc.  And not all smilies
## on these sites use sprite images, so some can be used as is.
##
## When replace_failed_smilies_with_alt_text:true, any images that
## failed to download or are src=clear.png *and* have a class containing
## mceSmilie and an alt attribute will be replaced with:
## <span class="(classes)">(alt text)</span>
##
## The smiley classes are preserved in case the user wants to do
## something special with them.
#replace_failed_smilies_with_alt_text:false

## SB, SV & QQ (but not AH) provide word counts with threadmarks.  Set
## use_threadmark_wordcounts:true to sum and use them to fill
## numWords.  skip_threadmarks_categories and ignore_chapter_url_list
## are applied *before* summing.
## SB, SV & QQ base_xenforoforum sites using use_threadmark_wordcounts
## is one of the few cases where numWords is effected by
## ignore_chapter_url_list.
## Note: that if always_include_first_post is true, first post will not
## be included in the word count if not also threadmarked.
## Note 2: Word counts from the site exclude words inside Spoiler
## tags.
use_threadmark_wordcounts:true

## base_xenforoforum stories with threadmarks have a few additional
## pieces of metadata available that most adapters don't. 'date';
## 'words'--word count as number only: "12104"; and kwords--the
## threadmark human-readable string for word count with parens:
## "(12.1k)" These can be used with custom output (see
## https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare/wiki/CustomOutput ) or with
## chapter_title_*_pattern settings.
## Examples for html & epub:
#[base_xenforoforum:html]
#tocpage_entry:
# <a href="#section${index04}">${chapter}</a> ${date} ${kwords}<br />
#[base_xenforoforum:epub]
#tocpage_entry:
# <a href="file${index04}.xhtml">${chapter}</a> ${date} ${kwords}<br /><br />

## The 'date' value for chapters mentioned above can be formated with
## datethreadmark_format.  Otherwise it will default to
## dateCreated_format
#datethreadmark_format:%%Y-%%m-%%d %%H:%%M

## The basic pattern used when not using add_chapter_numbers or
## mark_new_chapters
#chapter_title_def_pattern:${title} ${date}

## Pattern used with add_chapter_numbers, but not mark_new_chapters
#chapter_title_add_pattern:${number}. ${title} ${date}

## Pattern used with mark_new_chapters, but not add_chapter_numbers
## (new) is just text and can be changed.
#chapter_title_new_pattern:(new) ${title} ${date}

## Pattern used with add_chapter_numbers and mark_new_chapters
## (new) is just text and can be changed.
#chapter_title_addnew_pattern:${number}. (new) ${title} ${date}

## When set true, always_include_first_post_chapters will cause FFF to
## treat both threadmarks *and* first post links as chapter links.
#always_include_first_post_chapters:false

[base_xenforoforum:epub]

## See remove_spoilers above for more about 'spoilers'.  This example
## shows how to put a simple line around spoiler blocks.  Uncomment
## all three lines, keep the leading space before .bbCodeSpoilerContainer.
#add_to_keep_html_attrs:,style
#add_to_output_css:
# .bbCodeSpoilerContainer { border: 1px solid black; padding: 2px; }

[base_xenforo2forum]
## [base_xenforoforum] also applied, but [base_xenforo2forum] takes
## precedence.  SV & SB only as of Oct 2019.

## Some additional 'thread' metadata entries.

# Just to remove '_'.
threadmarks_title_label:Threadmarks Title
threadmarks_description_label:Threadmarks Description
threadmarks_status_label:Threadmarks Status

## When use_threadmarks_description is set true,
## threadmarks_description will be used to fill in the standard
## description metadata entry.  Some stories have poor
## threadmarks_description, you can use this setting to avoid using
## it.
use_threadmarks_description:true
## Increasing description_limit from base_xenforoforum's default of
## 500 is also useful with use_threadmarks_description
description_limit:1000

## When use_threadmarks_status is set true, a normalized version of
## threadmarks_status will be used to fill in the standard status
## metadata entry. (In-Progress, Completed plus site statuses.)
use_threadmarks_status:true

## When use_threadmarks_cover is set true, the threadmarks image will
## be used to fill in the cover image.  Set true by default.
use_threadmarks_cover:true

## Sometimes there's a sticky post first (often a Staff Post?) rather
## than the true first post by the Original Poster, AKA author.  By
## default, base_xenforo2forum will skip up to two sticky first posts.
## Configurable due to the extremely small sample size available when
## this was implemented.
skip_sticky_first_posts:true

## archiveofourown.org stories allow chapters to be added out of

## extra_titlepage_entries, logpage_entries, extra_logpage_entries,
## and include_in_* config items.  You can also add additional entries
## here to build up composite metadata entries.
## archiveofourown.org, for example, fills genre (a standard
## entry) as the composite offreeformtags, ao3categories in
## include_in_genre.  If there's ever more than 4 series, add

#exclude_notes:authorheadnotes,chaptersummary,chapterheadnotes,chapterfootnotes,authorfootnotes,inspiredlinks

## AO3 authorfootnotes and inspiredlinks end up in the 'last' chapter,
## but if updated, then there's a new 'last' chapter, leaving multiple
## copies.  This option applies the 'skip_on_ffdl_update' class to
## those tags which means they will be removed during epub reading for
## update.  This will only effect chapters added after turning the
## setting on.
## Result: Only the last chapter will have end notes.
## Side-effect: An 'Update Always' that doesn't add a new last
## chapter will also remove the end notes.

## AO3 allows users to archive stories they didn't write in certain
## cases.  These are indicated by showing a byline such as:
## 'Orig Author [archived by Archivist Author]'
## If use_archived_author is set true (and there's only one author
## listed), author will be set to 'Orig Author' instead of 'Archivist
## Author'.  authorUrl will still point to the Archivist Author's page.
#use_archived_author:false

## AO3 chapters have 'date' available for each chapter.
## These can be used with custom output (see
## https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare/wiki/CustomOutput ) or with
## chapter_title_*_pattern settings.
## Examples for html & epub:
#[html]
#tocpage_entry:
# <a href="#section${index04}">${chapter}</a> ${date}<br />
#[epub]
#tocpage_entry:
# <a href="file${index04}.xhtml">${chapter}</a> ${date}<br /><br />

## The 'date' value for chapters mentioned above can be formated with
## datechapter_format.  Otherwise it will default to
## datePublished_format
#datechapter_format:%%Y-%%m-%%d

## https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare/wiki/CustomOutput ) or with

## Examples for html & epub:
#[html]
#tocpage_entry:
#  <a href="#section${index04}">${chapter}</a> ${date} ${size}<br />
#[epub]
#tocpage_entry:
# <a href="file${index04}.xhtml">${chapter}</a> ${date} ${size}<br /><br />

## The 'date' and 'update' value for chapters mentioned above can be

#datechapter_format:%%Y-%%m-%%d

## Sometimes (perhaps often?) HF stories word counts and size are
