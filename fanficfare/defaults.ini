## items to include in the title page
## Empty metadata entries will *not* appear, even if in the list.
## You can include extra text or HTML that will be included as-is in

## Try to collect series name and number of this story in series.
## Some sites (ab)use 'series' for reading lists and personal
## collections.  This lets us turn it on and off by site without
## keeping a lengthy titlepage_entries per site and prevents it
## updating in the plugin.
collect_series: true

## include title page as first page.
include_titlepage: true

## include a TOC page before the story text
include_tocpage: true

## website encoding(s) In theory, each website reports the character
## encoding they use for each page.  In practice, some sites report it
## incorrectly.  Each adapter has a default list, usually "utf8,
## Windows-1252" or "Windows-1252, utf8", but this will let you
## explicitly set the encoding and order if you need to.  The special
## value 'auto' will call chardet and use the encoding it reports if
## it has +90% confidence.  'auto' is not reliable.
#website_encodings: auto, utf8, Windows-1252

## python string Template, string with ${title}, ${author} etc, same as titlepage_entries
## Can include directories.
#output_filename: books/${title}-${siteabbrev}_${storyId}${formatext}
#output_filename: books/${formatname}/${siteabbrev}/${authorId}/${title}-${siteabbrev}_${storyId}${formatext}
output_filename: ${title}-${siteabbrev}_${storyId}${formatext}

## Make directories as needed.
make_directories: true

## Always overwrite output files.  Otherwise, the downloader checks
## the timestamp on the existing file and only overwrites if the story
## has been updated more recently.  Command line version only
#always_overwrite: true

## put output (with output_filename) in a zip file zip_filename.
zip_output: false

## Can include directories.
zip_filename: ${title}-${siteabbrev}_${storyId}${formatext}.zip

## Normally, try to make the filenames 'safe' by removing invalid
## filename chars.  Applies to default_cover_image, output_filename &
## zip_filename.
allow_unsafe_filename: false

## The regex pattern of 'unsafe' filename chars for above.  First
## character . OR any one or more characters that are NOT a letter,
## number, or one of _. []()&'-
output_filename_safepattern:(^\.|/\.|[^a-zA-Z0-9_\. \[\]\(\)&'-]+)

## entries to make epub subjects and calibre tags
## lastupdate creates two tags: "Last Update Year/Month: %Y/%m" and "Last Update: %Y/%m/%d"
include_subject_tags: extratags, genre, category, characters, ships, lastupdate, status

## extra tags (comma separated) to include, primarily for epub.
extratags: FanFiction

## extra categories, genres, characters, ships and warnings can be
## configured.  Used primarily for sites that are dedicated to a genre
## or 'ship and so don't included it for every story.
#extracategories:
#extragenres:
#extracharacters:
#extraships:
#extrawarnings:

## Add this to genre if there's more than one category.
#add_genre_when_multi_category: Crossover

## default_value_(entry) can be used to set the value for a metadata
## entry when no value has been found on the site.  For example, some
## sites doesn't have a status metadatum.  If uncommented, this will
## use 'Unknown' for status when no status is found.
#default_value_status:Unknown
## Can also be used for other metadata values
#default_value_category:FanFiction

## number of seconds to sleep between calls to the story site.  May by
## useful if pulling large numbers of stories or if the site is slow.
#slow_down_sleep_time:0.5

## How long to wait for each HTTP connection to finish.  Longer times
## are better for sites that are slow to respond.  Shorter times
## prevent excessive wait when your network or the site is down.
connect_timeout:60.0

## For use only with stand-alone CLI version--run a command on the
## generated file after it's produced.  All of the titlepage_entries
## values are available, plus output_filename.
#post_process_cmd: addbook -f "${output_filename}" -t "${title}"

## Use regular expressions to find and replace (or remove) metadata.
## For example, you could change Sci-Fi=>SF, remove *-Centered tags,
## etc.  See http://docs.python.org/library/re.html (look for re.sub)
## for regexp details.
##
## Make sure to keep at least one space at the start of each line and
## to escape % to %%, if used.
##
## Two, three or five part lines.  Two part effect everything.
## Three part effect only those key(s) lists.
## *Five* part lines.  Effect only when trailing conditional key=>regexp matches
## metakey[,metakey]=>pattern=>replacement[&&conditionalkey=>regexp]
##
## Note that if metakey == conditionalkey the conditional is ignored.
## You can use \s in the replacement to add explicit spaces.  (The config parser
## tends to discard trailing spaces.)
##
## replace_metadata <entry>_LIST options: FanFicFare replace_metadata lines
## operate on individual list items for list entries. But if you
## want to do a replacement on the joined string for the whole list,
## you can by using <entry>_LIST. Example, if you added
## calibre_author: calibre_author_LIST=>^(.{,100}).*$=>\1
##
## You can 'split' one list item into multiple list entries by using
## \' in the replacement string.
##
## Examples:
#replace_metadata:
# genre,category=>Sci-Fi=>SF
# Puella Magi Madoka Magica.* => Madoka
# Comedy=>Humor
# Crossover: (.*)=>\1
# title=>(.*)Great(.*)=>\1Moderate\2
# .*-Centered=>
# characters=>Sam W\.=>Sam Witwicky&&category=>Transformers
# characters=>Sam W\.=>Sam Winchester&&category=>Supernatural
# category=>Bitextual=>M/M\,F/M


## Include/Exclude metadata
##
## You can use the include/exclude metadata features to either limit
## the values of particular metadata lists to specific values or to
## exclude specific values.  Further, you can conditionally apply each
## line depending on other metadata, use exact strings or regular
## expressions(regex) to match values, and negate matches.
##
## The settings are:
## include_metadata_pre
## exclude_metadata_pre
## include_metadata_post
## exclude_metadata_post
##
## The form of each line is:
## metakey[,metakey]==exactvalue
## metakey[,metakey]=~regex
## metakey[,metakey]==exactvalue&&conditionalkey==exactcondvalue
## metakey[,metakey]=~regex&&conditionalkey==exactcondvalue
## metakey[,metakey]==exactvalue&&conditionalkey=~condregex
##
## This is fairly complicated, so it's documented on its own wiki
## page:
## https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare/wiki/InExcludeMetadataFeature

## Some readers don't show horizontal rule (<hr />) tags correctly.
## This replaces them all with a centered '* * *'.  (Note centering
## doesn't work on some devices either.)
#replace_hr: false

## Some sites/authors/stories use br tags instead of p tags for
## paragraphs.  This feature uses some heuristics to find and replace
## br paragraphs with p tags while preserving scene breaks.
#replace_br_with_p: false

## If set false, the summary will have all html stripped.
## Both this and include_images must be true to get images in the
## summary.
keep_summary_html:true

## If set true, any style attributes on tags in the story HTML will be
## kept.  Useful for keeping extra colors & formatting from original.
## DEPRECATED - use keep_html_attrs (or add_to_keep_html_attrs) instead.
#keep_style_attr: false

## If set true, any title attributes on tags in the story HTML will be
## kept.  Some sites(AO3) use <a title="Translation">Foreign language</a>
## DEPRECATED - use keep_html_attrs (or add_to_keep_html_attrs) instead.
#keep_title_attr: false

## Some attributes cause problems for EBook readers.  By default,
## FanFicFare will remove all attributes except the ones specified
## from all tags.  (The only exception is that <img> tags will also
## keep src, alt and longdesc attributes.)
## Example: To add 'style', 'title' and 'align' to the list to keep,
## in your personal.ini [defaults] put:
## add_to_keep_html_attrs:,style,title,align
keep_html_attrs:href,name,class,id

## Tags listed here will be replaced with <span class="tagname">.
## For example: <u>underlined text</u> becomes
## <span class="u">underlined text</span>
## Note that the output_css should contain the class .u, .big, etc for
## the spans to be useful.
## This feature is for replacing old tags deprecated/removed in newer
## HTML and EPUB standards.
replace_tags_with_spans:u,big,small

## If a chapter range was given, use this pattern for the book title.
## replace_metadata and include/exclude will be applied *after* this.
## Set to empty value to disable.
title_chapter_range_pattern:${title} (Ch ${first}-${last})

## Don't like the numbers at the start of chapter titles on some
## sites?  You can use strip_chapter_numbers to strip them off.  Just
## want to make them all look the same?  Strip them off, then add them
## back on with add_chapter_numbers:true.  Only want them added back
## on for Table of Contents(toc)? Use add_chapter_numbers:toconly.
## (toconly doesn't work on mobi output.)  Don't like the way it
## strips numbers or adds them back?  See chapter_title_strip_pattern
## and chapter_title_add_pattern.
strip_chapter_numbers:false

## add_chapter_numbers can be true, false or toconly
## (Note number is not added when there's only one chapter.)
add_chapter_numbers:false

## (Two versions of chapter_title_strip_pattern are shown below.  You
## should only have one uncommented.)
## This version will remove the leading number from:
## "1." => ""
## "1. The Beginning" => "The Beginning"
## "1: Start" => "Start"
## "2, Chapter the second" => "Chapter the second"
## etc
## Leaves unchanged "1.1" or "1"
## Note that your ToC entry(ies) may be empty if the
## chapter_title_strip_pattern removes everything and you don't have
## add_chapter_numbers:true.
chapter_title_strip_pattern:^[0-9]+[\.: -]+(?=[^0-9]|$)

## This version remove leading numbers and 'Chapter 1':
## "Chapter 1" => ""
## "1. Chapter 1" => ""
## "1. Chapter 1, Bob's First Clue" => "Bob's First Clue"
## "Chapter 2 - Pirates Place" => "Pirates Place"
## etc
## Note that your ToC entry(ies) may be empty if the
## chapter_title_strip_pattern removes everything and you don't have
## add_chapter_numbers:true.
#chapter_title_strip_pattern:^([0-9]+[\.: -]+)?(Chapter *[0-9]+[\.:, -]*)?

## If true, when updating an epub that already has old chapters, new
## chapters will be marked in the TOC and chapter header by using
## chapter_title_new_pattern and chapter_title_addnew_pattern to set the chapter.
mark_new_chapters:false

## chapter title patterns use python template substitution.  The
## ${index} is the 'chapter' number and ${title} is the chapter title,
## after applying chapter_title_strip_pattern.  Those are the only
## variables available.

## The basic pattern used when not using add_chapter_numbers or
## mark_new_chapters
chapter_title_def_pattern:${title}

## Pattern used with add_chapter_numbers, but not mark_new_chapters

## Reorder ships so b/a and c/b/a become a/b and a/b/c. '/' is no
## longer hard coded and can be changed and added to with
## sort_ships_splits.
sort_ships:false

## Each line indicates first a regex that should be used to split each
## ships entry and then, after => the string to use to merge the parts
## back together.  \s == blank space.
## Each part will have replace_metadata with key ships_CHARS applied.
sort_ships_splits:
 [ ]*/[ ]*=>/
 [ ]*&amp;[ ]*=>\s&amp;\s

## join_string_<entry> options -- FanFicFare list entries are comma
## separated by default. You can use this to change that. For example,
## if you want authors separated with ' & ' instead, use
## join_string_calibre_author:\s&\s. (\s == space)
#join_string_author:,\s

## keep_in_order_<entry> options: FanFicFare sorts list entries by default
## (except for author/authorUrl/authorId). But if you want to use an
## extra entry derived from author, it ends up sorted. For example, if
## you added calibre_author: keep_in_order_calibre_author:true
#keep_in_order_author:true

## User-agent
user_agent:FFF/2.X

## Added for [base_xenforoforum], but can be used with other sites,
## too.  Limit the 'description' to the first X *characters*
## collected.  Character count includes HTML tags, so it can be
## non-intuitive.
#description_limit:1000

## The FFF CLI can fetch story URLs from unread emails when configured
## to read from your IMAP mail server.  The example shows GMail, but
## other services that support IMAP can be used.  GMail requires you
## to turn on an option to enable IMAP access. Only the CLI uses these
## options--the Calibre Plugin stores these separately.
##
## It's safest if you create a separate email account that you use
## only for your story update notices.  FanFicFare cannot guarantee
## that malicious code cannot get your email password once you've
## saved it. Use this feature at your own risk.
##
#imap_server:imap.gmail.com

## Mark mails with story URLs read:
## imap_mark_read can be 'true', 'false'(default) or 'downloadonly'.
##
## If 'true', unread emails will be marked as read when
## either CLI option --imap to list the story URLs or --download-imap
## to download story URLs from email are used.
##
## If 'downloadonly', unread emails will be marked as read
## only when CLI --download-imap to download story URLs from email are
## used.
##
## If 'false', unread emails will not be marked as read.
##
## Only unread emails will be searched for story URLs, and only emails
## containing valid story URLs will ever be marked read.

## For another example, you could, by uncommenting this line, include
