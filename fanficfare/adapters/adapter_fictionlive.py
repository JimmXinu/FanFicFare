#### Hazel's fiction.live fanficfare adapter
# what an *adventure* this was. fiction.live is an angular web3.0 app that does async background stuff everywhere.
# they're not kidding about it being live.
# can I wrangle it's stories into books for offline reading? yes I 98% can!

### won't support, because they aren't part of the text
# chat, threads, chat replies on vote options

### can't support because wtf this is a book
# music / audio embeds 
# per-user achivement tracking with fancy achievement-get animations
# story scripting (shows script tags visible in the text, not computed values or input fields)
# multiroute stories (won't download them at all)

# if bookmarks do change, it may not be as simple as adding new ones to the end
