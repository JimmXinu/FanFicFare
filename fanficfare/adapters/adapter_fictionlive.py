#### Hazel's fiction.live fanficfare adapter
# what an *adventure* this was. fiction.live is an angular web3.0 app that does async background stuff everywhere.
# they're not kidding about it being live.
# can I wrangle it's stories into books for offline reading? yes I 98% can!

### won't support, because they aren't part of the text
# chat, threads, chat replies on vote options

### can't support because wtf this is a book
# music / audio embeds
# per-user achivement tracking with fancy achievement-get animations
# story scripting (shows script tags visible in the text, not computed values or input fields)

# set fanficfare plugin to use "overwrite if newer" ? or 'update epub always' ?
# a lot of times, chunks will be added even when chapters/bookmarks don't change
# if bookmarks do change, it may not be as simple as adding new ones to the end

# TODO: verify that show_timestamps is working, check times!

# TODO: find a story that uses achievement images and implement them

# TODO: sort out updates, somehow. 'update epub if new chapters' is an awful match for fiction.live
# where chunks get just dropped at the end of chapters, and chapter-bookmarking happens later.
# updating in 'overwrite always' or 'overwrite if newer' does the right thing, but.

# TODO: pagecache. In particular, if there's any way to update stories and *not* redownload images, that'd be great.
