## overridden at several levels

## Sometimes Fantasy is category *and* a genre (fictionpress.com)
## Sometimes there are multiple categories and/or genres.
category_label:Category
genre_label:Genre
characters_label:Characters
## Completed/In-Progress
status_label:Status
## Dates story first published, last updated, and downloaded(last with time).
datePublished_label:Published
dateUpdated_label:Updated

rating_label:Rating
## Also depends on the site.

## The version of fanficdownloader
##
version_label:FFD Version

## items to include in the title page
## Empty entries will *not* appear, even if in the list.
## All current formats already include title and author.
titlepage_entries: category,genre,characters,status,datePublished,dateUpdated,dateCreated,rating,warnings,numChapters,numWords,site,description

## include title page as first page.
include_titlepage: true

## include a TOC page before the story text
include_tocpage: true

## website encoding(s) In theory, each website reports the character
## encoding they use for each page.  In practice, some sites report it
## incorrectly.  Each adapter has a default list, usually "utf8,
## Windows-1252" or "Windows-1252, utf8", but this will let you
## explicitly set the encoding and order if you need to.  The special
## value 'auto' will call chardet and use the encoding it reports if
## it has +90% confidence.  'auto' is not reliable.
#website_encodings: auto, utf8, Windows-1252

## python string Template, string with ${title}, ${author} etc, same as titlepage_entries
## Can include directories.  ${formatext} will be added if not in filename somewhere.
#output_filename: books/${title}-${siteabbrev}_${storyId}${formatext}
#output_filename: books/${formatname}/${siteabbrev}/${authorId}/${title}-${siteabbrev}_${storyId}${formatext}
output_filename: ${title}-${siteabbrev}_${storyId}${formatext}
## Make directories as needed.
make_directories: true
## Always overwrite output files.  Otherwise, the downloader checks
## the timestamp on the existing file and only overwrites if the story
## has been updated more recently.  Command line version only
#always_overwrite: true

## put output (with output_filename) in a zip file zip_filename.
zip_output: false
## Can include directories.  .zip will be added if not in name somewhere
zip_filename: ${title}-${siteabbrev}_${storyId}${formatext}.zip

## Normally, try to make the output file name 'safe' by removing
## invalid filename chars.  Applies to both output_filename &
## zip_filename.  
allow_unsafe_filename: false

## entries to make epub subjects and calibre tags
## lastupdate creates two tags: "Last Update Year/Month: %Y/%m" and "Last Update: %Y/%m/%d"
include_subject_tags: extratags, genre, category, characters, lastupdate, status

## extra tags (comma separated) to include, primarily for epub.

## number of seconds to sleep between calls to the story site.  May by
## useful if pulling large numbers of stories or if the site is slow.

#slow_down_sleep_time:0.5

## output background color--only used by html and epub (and ignored in
## epub by many readers).  Must be hex code, # will be added.
background_color: ffffff

## For use only with stand-alone CLI version--run a command on the
## generated file after it's produced.  All of the titlepage_entries
## values are available, plus output_filename.
#post_process_cmd: addbook -f "${output_filename}" -t "${title}"

## Each output format has a section that overrides [defaults]

## epub->mobi conversions typically don't like tables.
titlepage_use_table: false

## When using tables, make these span both columns.
wide_titlepage_entries: description, storyUrl, author URL

[mobi]
## mobi TOC cannot be turned off right now.
#include_tocpage: true


## Each site has a section that overrides [defaults] *and* the format
## sections test1.com specifically is not a real story site.  Instead,
## it is a fake site for testing configuration and output.  It uses
## URLs like: http://test1.com?sid=12345
[test1.com]
