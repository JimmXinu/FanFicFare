[defaults]

## [defaults] section applies to all formats and sites but may be
## overridden at several levels

## Some sites also require the user to confirm they are adult for
## adult content.  In commandline version, this should go in your
## personal.ini, not defaults.ini.
#is_adult:true

## All available titlepage_entries and the label used for them:
## <entryname>_label:<label>
## Labels may be customized.

## epub, txt, html

## Category and Genre have overlap, depending on the site.
## Sometimes Harry Potter is a category and Fantasy a genre. (fanfiction.net)
## Sometimes Fantasy is category *and* a genre (fictionpress.com)
## Sometimes there are multiple categories and/or genres.

## Empty entries will *not* appear, even if in the list.
## All current formats already include title and author.
titlepage_entries: series,category,genre,language,characters,status,datePublished,dateUpdated,dateCreated,rating,warnings,numChapters,numWords,site,description

## Try to collect series name and number of this story in series.
## Some sites (ab)use 'series' for reading lists and personal
## collections.  This lets us turn it on and off by site without
## keeping a lengthy titlepage_entries per site and prevents it
## updating in the plugin.
collect_series: true

## include title page as first page.
include_titlepage: true

## include a TOC page before the story text
include_tocpage: true

## website encoding(s) In theory, each website reports the character
## encoding they use for each page.  In practice, some sites report it
## incorrectly.  Each adapter has a default list, usually "utf8,
## Windows-1252" or "Windows-1252, utf8", but this will let you
## explicitly set the encoding and order if you need to.  The special
## value 'auto' will call chardet and use the encoding it reports if
## it has +90% confidence.  'auto' is not reliable.
#website_encodings: auto, utf8, Windows-1252

## entries to make epub subjects and calibre tags
## lastupdate creates two tags: "Last Update Year/Month: %Y/%m" and "Last Update: %Y/%m/%d"
include_subject_tags: extratags, genre, category, characters, status

## extra tags (comma separated) to include, primarily for epub.

#slow_down_sleep_time:0.5

## output background color--only used by html and epub (and ignored in
## epub by many readers).  Must be hex code, # will be added.
background_color: ffffff

## Use regular expressions to find and replace (or remove) metadata.
## For example, you could change Sci-Fi=>SF, remove *-Centered tags,
## etc.  See http://docs.python.org/library/re.html (look for re.sub)
## for regexp details.
## Make sure to keep at least one space at the start of each line and
## to escape % to %%, if used.
#replace_metadata:
# Sci-Fi=>SF
# Puella Magi Madoka Magica.* => Madoka
# Comedy=>Humor
# Crossover: (.*)=>\1
# (.*)Great(.*)=>\1Moderate\2
# .*-Centered=>

## Each output format has a section that overrides [defaults]
