[defaults]

## [defaults] section applies to all formats and sites but may be
## overridden at several levels

## Some sites also require the user to confirm they are adult for
## adult content.  Uncomment by removing '#' in front of is_adult.
#is_adult:true

## All available titlepage_entries and the label used for them:
## <entryname>_label:<label>
## Labels may be customized.
title_label:Title

## epub, txt, html

## Category and Genre have overlap, depending on the site.
## Sometimes Harry Potter is a category and Fantasy a genre. (fanfiction.net)
## Sometimes Fantasy is category *and* a genre (fictionpress.com)
## Sometimes there are multiple categories and/or genres.

## items to include in the title page
## Empty metadata entries will *not* appear, even if in the list.
## You can include extra text or HTML that will be included as-is in

## All current formats already include title and author.

## Try to collect series name and number of this story in series.
## Some sites (ab)use 'series' for reading lists and personal
## collections.  This lets us turn it on and off by site without
## keeping a lengthy titlepage_entries per site and prevents it
## updating in the plugin.
collect_series: true

## include title page as first page.
include_titlepage: true

## include a TOC page before the story text
include_tocpage: true

## website encoding(s) In theory, each website reports the character
## encoding they use for each page.  In practice, some sites report it
## incorrectly.  Each adapter has a default list, usually "utf8,
## Windows-1252" or "Windows-1252, utf8", but this will let you
## explicitly set the encoding and order if you need to.  The special
## value 'auto' will call chardet and use the encoding it reports if
## it has +90% confidence.  'auto' is not reliable.
#website_encodings: auto, utf8, Windows-1252

## entries to make epub subjects and calibre tags
## lastupdate creates two tags: "Last Update Year/Month: %Y/%m" and "Last Update: %Y/%m/%d"
include_subject_tags: extratags, genre, category, characters, ships, status

## extra tags (comma separated) to include, primarily for epub.
extratags: FanFiction

## extra categories, genres, characters, ships and warnings can be
## configured.  Used primarily for sites that are dedicated to a genre
## or 'ship and so don't included it for every story.

## number of seconds to sleep between calls to the story site.  May by

#slow_down_sleep_time:0.5

## Use regular expressions to find and replace (or remove) metadata.
## For example, you could change Sci-Fi=>SF, remove *-Centered tags,
## etc.  See http://docs.python.org/library/re.html (look for re.sub)
## for regexp details.
## Make sure to keep at least one space at the start of each line and
## to escape % to %%, if used.
## Two, three or five part lines.  Two part effect everything.
## Three part effect only those key(s) lists.
## *Five* part lines.  Effect only when trailing conditional key=>regexp matches
## metakey[,metakey]=>pattern=>replacement[&&conditionalkey=>regexp]
## Note that if metakey == conditionalkey the conditional is ignored.
#replace_metadata:
# genre,category=>Sci-Fi=>SF
# Puella Magi Madoka Magica.* => Madoka
# Comedy=>Humor
# Crossover: (.*)=>\1
# title=>(.*)Great(.*)=>\1Moderate\2
# .*-Centered=>
# characters=>Sam W\.=>Sam Witwicky&&category=>Transformers
# characters=>Sam W\.=>Sam Winchester&&category=>Supernatural
 
## Some readers don't show horizontal rule (<hr />) tags correctly.
## This replaces them all with a centered '* * *'.  (Note centering
## doesn't work on some devices either.)
#replace_hr: false

## If you have the Generate Cover plugin installed, you can use the
## generate_cover_settings parameter to intelligently decide which GC
## setting to run.  There are three parts 1) a template of which
## metadata part(s) to look at, 2) a regular expression to match the
## template, and 3) the name of the GC setting to use, which must
## match exactly.  Use this parameter in [defaults], or by site eg,
## [www.ficwad.com]
## Make sure to keep at least one space at the start of each line and
## to escape % to %%, if used.
## template => regexp to match => GC Setting to use.
#generate_cover_settings:
# ${category} => Buffy:? [tT]he Vampire Slayer => BuffyCover
# ${category} => Star Trek => StarTrekCover

## If set false, the summary will have all html stripped.
## Both this and include_images must be true to get images in the
## summary.
keep_summary_html:true

## Don't like the numbers at the start of chapter titles on some
## sites?  You can use strip_chapter_numbers to strip them off.  Just
## want to make them all look the same?  Strip them off, then add them
## back on with add_chapter_numbers:true.  Only want them added back
## on for Table of Contents(toc)? Use add_chapter_numbers:toconly.
## (toconly doesn't work on mobi output.)  Don't like the way it
## strips numbers or adds them back?  See chapter_title_strip_pattern
## and chapter_title_add_pattern.
strip_chapter_numbers:false

## add_chapter_numbers can be true, false or toconly
## (Note number is not added when there's only one chapter.)
add_chapter_numbers:false

## (Two versions of chapter_title_strip_pattern are shown below.  You
## should only have one uncommented.)
## This version will remove the leading number from:
## "1." => ""
## "1. The Beginning" => "The Beginning"
## "1: Start" => "Start"
## "2, Chapter the second" => "Chapter the second"
## etc
chapter_title_strip_pattern:^[0-9]+[\.: -]+

## This version will strip all of the above *plus* remove 'Chapter 1':
## "Chapter 1" => ""
## "1. Chapter 1" => ""
## "1. Chapter 1, Bob's First Clue" => "Bob's First Clue"
## "Chapter 2 - Pirates Place" => "Pirates Place"
## etc
#chapter_title_strip_pattern:^([0-9]+[\.: -]+)?(Chapter *[0-9]+[\.:, -]*)?

## Uses a python template substitution.  The ${index} is the 'chapter'
## number and ${title} is the chapter title, after applying
## chapter_title_strip_pattern.  Those are the only variables available.
## "The Beginning" => "1. The Beginning" 
chapter_title_add_pattern:${index}. ${title}

## Some adapters collect additional meta information beyond the

## tell the rest of the FFDL system about them.  They can be used in
## include_subject_tags, titlepage_entries, extra_titlepage_entries,

## items.  You can also add additional entries here to build up
## composite metadata entries.  dramione.org, for example, adds
## 'cliches' and then defines as the composite of hermiones,dracos in
## include_in_cliches.
extra_valid_entries:themes,hermiones,dracos,timeline,cliches
include_in_cliches:hermiones,dracos

## For another example, you could, by uncommenting this line, include
## themes in with genre metadata.
#include_in_genre:genre, themes

## You can give each new valid entry a specific label for use on
## titlepage and logpage.  If not defined, it will simply be the 
themes_label:Themes
hermiones_label:Hermiones
dracos_label:Dracos
timeline_label:Timeline
cliches_label:Character Cliches

## extra_titlepage_entries (and extra_logpage_entries) *add* to
## titlepage_entries (and logpage_entries) so you can add site
## specific entries to titlepage/logpage without having to copy the
## entire titlepage_entries line.  (But if you want them higher than

#extra_titlepage_entries: themes,timeline,cliches

## (Plugin Only) - You can also populate calibre custom columns with
## the site specific metadata using custom_columns_settings (but only
## if 'Allow custom_columns_settings from personal.ini' is checked in
## the plugin GUI config.)  There are three parts, the entry name,
## then the label of the calibre custom column, then (optionally) a
## 'mode'.  'r' to Replace any existing values, 'a' to Add to existing
## value (use with tag-like columns), and 'n' for setting on New books
## only.  (Default is 'r'.)
## Each metadata=>column mapping must be on a separate line and each
## needs to have one space at the start of each line.
